# Building and running Piconot

In the console, you should be at root of the directory, which is where you want to be.

Enter: sbt run "mazefilename and location" "programfilename/location"

Here,
sbt run "resources/empty.txt" "src/main/scala/piconot/politeExternal/Empty.bot"

Or 

sbt run "resources/maze.txt" "src/main/scala/piconot/politeExternal/RightHand.txt"
